                <p>Leverage agile frameworks to provide a robust synopsis for high level overviews. Iterative approaches to corporate strategy foster collaborative thinking to further the overall value proposition. Organically grow the holistic world view of disruptive innovation via workplace diversity and empowerment.</p>

                <p>Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring.</p>

                <p>Capitalize on low hanging fruit to identify a ballpark value added activity to beta test. Override the digital divide with additional clickthroughs from DevOps. Nanotechnology immersion along the information highway will close the loop on focusing solely on the bottom line.</p>

                    <p>The hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores. I have a plan that would have already begun redeploying our troops with the goal of bringing all our combat brigades home by March 31st of next year. That's why organizations are rising up across the country to reclaim the language of faith to bring about change. It's a story that hasn't made me the most conventional candidate. But the truth is, that isn't all that I know of the man. It is easy to point fingers - for Palestinians to point to the displacement brought by Israel's founding, and for Israelis to point to the constant hostility and attacks throughout its history from within its borders as well as beyond.</p>

                    <p>The hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. Our conscience can't rest so long as 37 million Americans are poor and forgotten by their leaders in Washington and by the media elites. And yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage, or provide men and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens of the United States. Not this time. As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.</p>

                <p>And yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage, or provide men and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens of the United States. I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk. That is why I intend to personally pursue this outcome with all the patience that the task requires. I am emphasizing such investments within my country.</p>

                <p>Back home, my grandmother raised their baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line. We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes. We meet at a time of tension between the United States and Muslims around the world - tension rooted in historical forces that go beyond any current policy debate. And I believe that America holds within her the truth that regardless of race, religion, or station in life, all of us share common aspirations - to live in peace and security; to get an education and to work with dignity; to love our families, our communities, and our God. Yet in this new age, such attitudes are self-defeating. And that is why we are providing more than $2.8 billion to help Afghans develop their economy and deliver services that people depend upon.</p>

                <p>I believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs and that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices, and meet the challenges that face us. But the anger is real; it is powerful; and to simply wish it away, to condemn it without understanding its roots, only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races. For centuries, black people in America suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation. And we will welcome all elected, peaceful governments - provided they govern with respect for all their people.</p>
